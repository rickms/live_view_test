# Material UI Implementation 


This repo includes a built version of the app, just run the server via:

    cargo run

Material UI version can be accessed at http://localhost:8000/mat/

The app can be run in debug mode without the backend server running (to see how api access errors are handled) from the `app_ts/` directory via:

    npm install
    npm start
